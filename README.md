# OutreachHub üìà

## 1. Implement Multi-Tenant (Workspaces) Platform

The platform comprises two major parts:

### a. Admin Portal
üìÅ For managing business workspaces and workspace users.

#### i. Access Control
- Only admin users can access this portal.

#### ii. Modules

##### 1. Authentication Module
- Login and Logout

##### 2. Workspaces Module
- List, create, view, update, and delete workspaces

###### a. Workspace Users Sub-Module
- List, create, view, update, and delete workspace users

---

### b. OutreachHub Portal (User Facing Portal)
üìä For workspace users with features like contacts, message templates, campaigns, and analytics.

#### i. Access Control
- Only workspace users can access this portal.

#### ii. Workspace User Roles

1. **Editor**: Can perform all operations on all modules  
2. **Viewer**: Can perform only read operations on all modules

#### iii. Modules

##### 1. Authentication Module
- Login and Logout

##### 2. Home Module

###### a. Welcome Message

###### b. Workspace Analytics

**Charts:**

1. Number of campaigns done per day (filterable by date range)  
2. Number of campaign messages sent per message type per day (filterable by date range)  
3. Number of contacts reached per day (filterable by date range)

**Tables:**

1. List of recent 5 campaigns with targeted contact tags  
2. List of top 5 tags with highest number of contacts  

---

##### 3. Contacts Module

- List, create, view, update, and delete contacts  
- Contacts can have multiple tags (used in campaigns to target specific sub-sets of contacts)  
- **Note**: Contacts will be primarily identified by phone number  

---

##### 4. Message Templates Module

- List, create, view, update, and delete message templates  
- Templates will support two types: `Text` and `Text & Image`  

---

##### 5. Campaigns Module

- List, create, view, update, delete, and copy campaigns  
- Newly created campaigns will be in a **draft** state  
- Separate **launch** action to actually run a campaign  

###### a. Campaign Launch Behavior
1. Virtually run a campaign and store message details per contact in the database  
2. **Note**: Store exact message data at the time of sending (even if contact/template changes later)  
3. Show live status transitions: `draft ‚Üí running ‚Üí completed` using polling to sync frontend with backend  

###### b. Campaign Rules
- Only **draft** campaigns can be updated  
- **Launched** campaigns cannot be updated  
- Add **copy** campaign action to duplicate a campaign with same configurations  

---

### c. Additional Use Case

Improve the system for cases where a user with the same email is added to more than one workspace.  
**Question**: How will the user access multiple workspaces from the OutreachHub portal?
